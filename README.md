Need to put around 8 questions to the CEO and CMO. 

<b> 1. Which region is generating the highest revenue, and which region is generating the lowest? </b>  
This question is important to the CEO as it is based on the fundamental source of income for the business, i.e., revenue. Revenue analysis is important to the CEO as top-level executives are always focused on earnings and how to increase it. Here, the CEO is interested in viewing revenue by the regions, to assess which regions are generating the highest revenue and which regions are generating lower revenue.  

Using the data and analysis, the CEO will be able to decide on how to further generate revenue in the regions that are already generating the most revenue. For the regions that are not generating enough revenue, the CEO will then study the reasons why there is a lack of sales in those regions and try to improve the products and make them more suitable for those regions.


<b> 2. What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease? </b>  
A monthly trend of revenue will provide the CEO with insights into how the revenue is fluctuating each month. This will enable the CEO to analyze how the internal changes inside the company have had impact on the sales. E.g., how a new product launch has led to an increase in revenue during the month or how the introduction of a new region has led to an increase in revenue for the online store. The CEO can also analyze if there have been any delays internally that would have caused a potential decrease. Such analysis is vital for the senior management as it would enable them to plan ahead and try to make the customer experience as smooth as possible.  


<b> 3. Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales? </b>  
In retail businesses, there are always months that will have a greater demand due to seasonality. There will be cases where the data will experience regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. Such seasonal months would be necessary to identify as the CEO would be interested in devising a strategy that would gain the maximum benefit from the months that have greater demands. 

<b> 4. Who are the top customers and how much do they contribute to the total revenue? Is the business dependent on these customers or is the customer base diversified? </b>
This analysis is highly important as it would enable the CEO to identify what the main drivers are behind the total revenue. Looking at the top customers of the retail store would provide an idea of which customers are contributing the most to the revenue. The store can then derive a strategy where the top customers can be targeted with more products that they can buy. This will ensure higher revenue for the store as these customers are the top buyers of the store. Although having fewer customers buying in high volumes can be beneficial for a business, there can also be a drawback. Retailers would have less bargaining power with these customers because they drive the majority of the revenue for the store and can negotiate lower prices. The CEO needs to be notified of the diversification of the customers so that he can plan ahead of time. In cases wehre the business is highly dependent on a few customers, the plan would be to increase the customer base and target more customers that would bring more revenue to the store.
