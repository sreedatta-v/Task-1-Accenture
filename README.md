# Task-1-Accenture

I'm working as a data analyst at Accenture company, where I'm working with a longer team with different roles and levels of responsibility. We are assigned with new project from client <b> Social Buzz </b>. 

## Key roles and responsibilities of a Data Analyst
• <b> The Business </b> refers to the client and your internal team members who won’t be involved in detailed data analysis.   
  
They rely on your analysis to make strategic business decisions.   
  
Importantly, not everyone will have a strong understanding of data. Your job is to communicate your data findings simply and clearly for everyone to understand.   
 
• <b> The Data </b> refers to the relevant data sources that you will clean, process, and use to generate interesting insights for the business.
